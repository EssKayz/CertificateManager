# CertificateManager
 
A tool for managing certificates for various technical tools and equipments.
Idea is, that a person can add a device to his profile, and then add certificates for the equipment.
This enables for easy tracking of the certificates and possible traceability information for any and all devices.

```
A place for people to manage electronic products they own, 
like adding all of their computer peripherals with their serial numbers,certificates (toDo)
so that they have a central management endpoint where they can see what they own from a single glance.
This can be essential for larger companies that own thousands of computers, power supplies etc - 
and they need one place where they can see if something is in need of calibration, 
service or if someone has marked the equipment as broken.
```
